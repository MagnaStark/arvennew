      {
        "question": "What is a \"fraction\" at Arven House?",
        "answer": "A fraction represents a stake in the ownership of a villa in Tulum. By buying fractions, you become a co-owner of the property and have the right to receive returns proportional to your investment, as well as enjoy the property according to the established agreement. The price per fraction is $555,000 MXN ($30,000 USD) or $499,500 MXN ($27,000 USD) with a 10% discount when reserving now."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often do I receive returns?",
        "answer": "Returns are distributed semi-annually. This means you will receive payments every 6 months, calculated based on the return on your investment and the number of fractions you own."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are returns guaranteed?",
        "answer": "No. The projections shown in our calculator are illustrative and based on conservative estimates of the Tulum real estate market. Actual returns may vary depending on multiple factors such as property occupancy, market conditions, and operating costs. The estimated appreciation of $850,000 MXN in 20 months is also not a guarantee. This does not constitute financial advice."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between financed and cash payment?",
        "answer": "Cash payment allows you to access higher returns (8-12% annual) starting from the first year, as there are no financing costs. Financed payment offers accessibility with scheduled payments, with returns of 5-8% annual that START AFTER you have fully paid off your investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "When do I start receiving returns if I finance?",
        "answer": "If you choose financing, returns begin AFTER you have completely paid off your fractions. For example, if you finance for 2 years, returns would start in year 3. During the financing period, your payments go toward paying off the investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the $850,000 MXN appreciation?",
        "answer": "Appreciation is the estimated increase in property value. We project that the value can reach up to $850,000 MXN over a period of 20 months (1 year and 8 months). This is an estimate based on the Tulum market and does not constitute a guarantee."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I sell my fractions?",
        "answer": "Yes, fractions can be sold, but this is subject to the conditions established in the co-ownership contract. Typically there is an approval process and other co-owners may have right of first refusal."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does property management work?",
        "answer": "Arven House handles all professional villa management: maintenance, cleaning, vacation rental marketing, guest services, and financial administration. You only receive your semi-annual returns without worrying about daily operations."
